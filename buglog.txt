#CP3.1
1. bootlooping
-> wrong sizing on GDT
2.# errors 
->"header file errors"
.S files were included .

3. #errors
->  "_" character not recognized
We were getting this error because the function in wrapper.S were defined in an incorrect format.

4, #errors
->  "unrecognized charcater"
We were getting this error becaus the interrupt handlers being passed in set idt were not defined in header file of wrapper.

5, #errors

->   "void value not ignored as it ought to be"
We were getting this error because our function declarations were incorrect.

6, RTC Testing Adequecy
-> Forgot to add a fail test for RTC hat ensure that the rates are powers of 2


#CP3.2
7, RTC Init
-> Did not disable interrupts for init of RTC which caused problems during hceckpoint 1 while trying ti initialise RTC and call the interrupts

8, File System
->File System test was page faulting, thought the datablock was a memory address instead of an index

9, File System
->Was not dereferencing the data read from file when setting buf equal to it


#CP3.3
10. page fault if a faulty file name was put in 
-> pid paging was being called before varifying if the file is valid 

11. sys_read sys_write returning -1 with correct register values
-> in systemcall handler we were pushing in eflags as the arguments instead of ebx ecx edx

12. General Protection Fault:

-> due to incorrect pushing of values in context switch


#CP3.4

11. page fault when trying to run fish
-> page dir page table and video page table were set to static

12. page fault when halting
-> We weren't pushing status on the stack

13. can only halt twice 
-> we werent restoring file despritor array to the pervious one (PCB_parent->file_descriptor)

14. GREP was causing a pagefault and gave random symbols 
->when opening the last file the offset didnt reset in file offset trying to read values that werent there 
    changes were made in read_dentry_by_name which now returns offset-original

15. syserr was pagefaulting at file open 
-> did not have an empty string check, added it to file open 

#CP3.5

16. PAGE FAULT & RESTART
-> Enable interrupt when initializing RTC, which allows scheduling before initializing terminals so we set curr_pid to -1 initially, and add a conditional check for this at the begin of the scheduler

17. The multiterminal skipped to terminal 3
-> The order in which we execute shells was weird 

18.  grep print out something when we does not enter arg
-> check no argument case in get_args

19. re initialized execute everytime pit handler was used
-> we initallized everything in pit handeler which we moved to terminal switching

20. page faults the 3rd time shell was called
-> didnt flush TLB, then we flushed it
